        //explore 5 string methods
/* 1. length:
Returns the length of the string (the number of characters).
let str = "Hello, world!"; //Output: 13
console.log(str.length);
2. toUpperCase():
Converts all characters in the string to uppercase.
let greeting = "hello there";
console.log(greeting.toUpperCase()); // Output: HELLO THERE
3. toLowerCase():
Converts all characters in the string to lowercase.
let message = "This is a MIXED CASE string";
console.log(message.toLowerCase()); // Output: this is a mixed case string
4. indexOf():
Searches for a specified substring within the string and returns its starting index (or -1 if not found).
let sentence = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog";
console.log(sentence.indexOf("fox")); // Output: 16
console.log(sentence.indexOf("cat")); // Output: -1
5. slice():
Extracts a portion of the string, starting at a specified index and ending at a specified index (exclusive).
let text = "JavaScript is fun!";
console.log(text.slice(10, 15)); // Output: "is fun" */

        //explore 5 array methods
/* javaScript arrays are powerful data structures that provide various methods for manipulating and working with their elements. Here are 5 commonly used array methods:

1. push()
Purpose: Adds one or more elements to the end of an array.
Syntax: array.push(element1, element2, ...)
let fruits = ["apple", "banana"];
fruits.push("orange", "grape");
console.log(fruits); // Output: ["apple", "banana", "orange", "grape"]
2. pop()
Purpose: Removes the last element from an array and returns it.
Syntax: array.pop()
let colors = ["red", "green", "blue"];
let lastColor = colors.pop();
console.log(lastColor); // Output: "blue"
console.log(colors); // Output: ["red", "green"]
3. shift()
Purpose: Removes the first element from an array and returns it.
Syntax: array.shift()
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
let firstNumber = numbers.shift();
console.log(firstNumber); // Output: 1
console.log(numbers); // Output: [2, 3, 4]
4. unshift()
Purpose: Adds one or more elements to the beginning of an array.
Syntax: array.unshift(element1, element2, ...)
let animals = ["cat", "dog"];
animals.unshift("bird", "fish");
console.log(animals); // Output: ["bird", "fish", "cat", "dog"]
5. join()
Purpose: Joins all elements of an array into a string, separated by a specified separator.
Syntax: array.join(separator)
let names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"];
let joinedNames = names.join(", ");
console.log(joinedNames); // Output: "Alice, Bob, Charlie" */


        //javascript objects
 /* Objects in JavaScript are fundamental data structures that represent real-world entities or concepts. They are collections of key-value pairs, where keys are used to access corresponding values.

Key Properties of Objects:

Key-value pairs: Objects store data in the form of key-value pairs. The keys are used to access the corresponding values.
Dynamic nature: Objects are dynamic, meaning you can add, remove, or modify properties at any time.
Customizable: You can create objects with any combination of properties and values to suit your specific needs.
Creating Objects:

There are two common ways to create objects in JavaScript:

1, Object literal notation:
let person = {
  firstName: "Alice",
  lastName: "Smith",
  age: 30,
  city: "New York"
};
2. Using the new Object() constructor:
let car = new Object();
car.make = "Toyota";
car.model = "Camry";
car.year = 2023;
Accessing Properties:
You can access properties of an object using dot notation or bracket notation:
console.log(person.firstName); // Output: Alice
console.log(car["model"]); // Output: Camry
Modifying Properties:
You can modify the values of properties by assigning new values:
person.age = 31;
car.year = 2024;
Adding and Removing Properties:
You can add new properties to an object by assigning values to them:
person.occupation = "Engineer";
You can remove properties using the delete operator:
delete car.year;
Methods:
Objects can also contain methods, which are functions defined within the object. Methods allow you to encapsulate behavior and logic related to the object.
let animal = {
  name: "Leo",
  species: "Cat",
  makeSound: function() {
    console.log("Meow!");
  }
};

animal.makeSound(); // Output: Meow!
Nested Objects:
Objects can contain other objects as properties, creating nested structures:
let address = {
  street: "123 Main St",
  city: "Anytown",
  state: "CA"
};

person.address = address;
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):

JavaScript is an object-oriented language, and objects play a central role in OOP concepts like classes, inheritance, and polymorphism.

By understanding objects, you can create well-structured, reusable, and modular JavaScript code. */
